## Architecture

The architecture of the project follows the principles of Clean Architecture and MVVM. Here's how the project implements it:


The app when run will displaya an interface that gives the user 2 options of how they want to input their card number.

</p>

This architecture is used in order to maintain clean coding and adhere to the SOLID principles of coding. Let's look at each of the architecture layers and the role each one plays :)

### Presentation layer

This layer contains the views(activity and fragments) and their ViewModel classes. The ViewModel receives its data from the use case layer and then supplies the views.

### Use case layer

This layer presents each individual action of the app.

### Domain layer

The domain layer contains the data transfer objects for the entire app.

### Data layer

The Data layer is our access point to external data source and is used to fetch data from multiple sources (examples are cache and network). In this case, it gets data from the remote source only.
